**Files to Release:**
- 29 files changed
- +11,886 insertions, -112 deletions

```toml
[package]
version = "0.7.0"

[dev-dependencies]
magneto-serge = { path = "..", version = "0.7.0" }
```

**Issue Encountered:** Initial commit failed due to workspace member version mismatch

## Error Handling

### Error 1: Cargo Workspace Version Mismatch

**Error Message:**
```
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `magneto-serge = "^0.6.0"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.7.0
location searched: /Users/sga/projects/matgto-serge
required by package `magneto-serge-test v0.6.0`
```

**Root Cause:**
- Updated main package and frontend to 0.7.0
- Forgot to update workspace member `magneto-serge-test`
- Both package version AND dependency version needed updating

**Fix:**
```bash
# Edit magneto-serge-test/Cargo.toml
git add magneto-serge-test/Cargo.toml
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push origin release/v0.7.0 --force
```

**Result:** âœ… Build succeeded after fix

## Known Issues (Documented)

### 1. InteractionDetailComponent Async Timing (2 tests)

**Root Cause:** Zone.js timing in error handling tests
**Impact:** Non-blocking (98.9% pass rate maintained)
**Status:** Documented in CHANGELOG
**Priority:** Low

**Tests Affected:**
- "should handle missing cassette name gracefully"
- "should handle errors when loading interaction"

**Mitigation:** Logic verified, only timing issues

### 2. AlcaeusService Not Unit Tested

**Reason:** Alcaeus library's `datasetFactory` difficult to mock
**Mitigation:** Fully covered via component integration tests
**Impact:** Minimal (coverage maintained via indirect testing)
